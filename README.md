## Featured Project

### [BankSim](https://github.com/users/ShtoikoVasyl/projects/2)
**BankSim** is an educational project simulating a banking system using a microservice architecture. The project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and manage a complex system using:
- **Spring Cloud (Config Server, Netflix Discovery, Gateway)**
- **gRPC for service communication**
- **Apache Kafka for event streaming**
- **Project Reactor (Spring WebFlux)** for reactive programming

I developed the project entirely on my own, overseeing every aspect of the design and implementation.
